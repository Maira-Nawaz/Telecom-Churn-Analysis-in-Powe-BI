# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-in-Powe-BI
This project analyzes customer churn patterns using a telecom dataset. The interactive Power BI dashboard explores key factors like contract types, partner status, and security services to uncover why customers leave. Built during my BI Trainee program at Ai DataYard, the goal was to turn raw data into actionable customer insights.
